Things that work:
* Accepting some music filenames on the command line
* Pointing the squeezebox at a local apache server to play files
* Rendering some nice things on the screen as it plays
* Pause / resume
* Skip to previous / next track with a nice popup display
* Volume up/down with a nice popup display
* Brightness

Things that don't work yet:
* Implement a file browser, or some minimal way to modify the playlist at runtime.
* Save client state to a file, retrieve it at server start time.
* Fix track skipping, it sometimes gets stuck streaming but not playing.
* Implement track seeking.  (Seeking backwards might be hard for big files.)
* Implement a popup seek bar.
* Implement a playlist browser/editor/selector.
* Optimize update_display(), it's a CPU hot spot.
* The softsqueeze3 app doesn't seem to work quite right, fix it.
* Fix up the boilerplate tests, add some real tests.
* Whittle down the CPAN requirements a bit more.
* Release it to CPAN.
