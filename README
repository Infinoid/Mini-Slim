Mini-Slim

This is an alternative to squeezecenter, previously known as slimserver.  It is
a fairly minimal server for slim devices (now logitech) products.

I wrote it because I wanted my squeezebox2 to run from a small embedded device
and was tired of squeezecenter trying to take up half a gig of RAM for no good
reason.

I don't intend to match squeezecenter's featureset, I'm just happy if
I have a working player at 1% of the size.


REQUIREMENTS

To use this application, you will need a modern version of perl, and the CPAN
modules mentioned in Build.PL.  You will also need direct filesystem access to
the music files you intend to play.

You will also a webserver running on port 80 on the same machine, which is
configured to serve the same music files.  (Unlike squeezecenter, this
application does not have a web server built in, but the player can stream
music just fine from apache or lighttpd.)


INSTALLATION

To install this application, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

CONFIGURATION

The server reads configuration from /etc/mini-slim.conf and $HOME/.mini-slim.
At a bare minimum, you will need to tell it how to get to your music, both via
the local filesystem and via the webserver.  If your music was at /media/music/
in your local filesystem, and you could get to the same place in a web browser
with "http://localhost/music/", you would use the following settings:

    musicdir: /media/music
    httpdir: /music


SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
